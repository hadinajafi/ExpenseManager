Ok, well. I write here my ideas and to-do list here to organize this project.

First of first is data, I selected SQLite db for storing user data.
User data saved thru tables and only thing I need is retrive data for specific category or time.

another note is about weekly and monthly views. I'll use TreeTableView. every week is a parent node and transactions are children.

the program has a toolbar for instant actions like adding expense/income faster.
toolbar is useful to show today info too.(today income/expense)(current balance)
